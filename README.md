# CentoDiciotto

Managing an Health Service has never been easier.

Meet CentoDiciotto, a full-fledged platform that puts you in control of your health and your healthcare services.

[Please read the PDF assignment for project information](docs/ProgettoWeb.pdf).

## Description

CentoDiciotto lets *Patient*s, *General Practitioner*s, *Specialized Doctor*s, *Chemist*s, and *Local Health Service*s to sign up and interact with the system.

Each account role has a predefined set of permissions that are listed below. The only common feature to all roles is password management (changing and resetting passwords).

All roles upon creation beside *Specialized Doctor*s are mapped to a specific Province (please visit [this page](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_d%27Italia) for information about Italian Provinces) that may not be changed, and restricts their operations (e.g. choosing a different *General Practitioner*, reading a *Patient*'s information) to the Province itself.

All notifications are delivered as emails to all roles.
